## About Video Color

### Search for information

All of us are faced with the task of finding information every day. You want to find text, images, audio or video information. Most often, text is used for a search query. Less commonly, images. There are services like "Shazam" that search for music using sound recording. We focused on building a search engine that searches for videos. We use images as parameters for the request.

### What is our advantage?

In short, our technology allows us to find the name of the film and the exact position in one frame with a sufficiently high accuracy. This first requires an analysis of the indexed file. Then the results are entered into the database. At the same time, the amount of stored data is relatively small, and the data storage structure allows searching very efficiently. So, for example, according to our calculations, a server with a fast PCI Express SSD disk with a capacity of about 15 TB will be able to store information about 1,000,000 hours of video and carry out tens (possibly hundreds) of search queries per second.

Kinopoisk:
Description:    In 'Round Midnight, real-life jazz legend Dexter Gordon brilliantly portrays the fictional tenor sax player Dale Turner, a musician slowly losing the battle with alcoholism, estranged from his family, and hanging on by a thread in the 1950's New York jazz world. Dale gets an offer to play in Paris, where, like many other black American musicians at the time, he enjoys a respect for his humanity that is not based upon the color of his skin. A Parisian man who is obsessed with Turner's music befriends him and attempts to save Turner from himself. Although for Dale the damage is already done, his poignant relationship with the man and his young daughter re-kindles his spirit and his music as the end draws near.
